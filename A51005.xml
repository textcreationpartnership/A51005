            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Kings and Potentates of the Earth can make Men Great, but it is the Donation of Heaven that can render them Virtuous and Wiſe. Indeed 'tis Happy when theſe Embelliſh with ſome Rays of their Image, where God firſt Imprinted His own: Whereby what Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they ſhew, or Honour they add to ſuch Perſons, Rebounds to the Original.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:59167:3"/>
            <p>And this the King, who well Weighs the fitneſs of Men for the Charges He puts them in, Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, when He made Choice of You, to ſerve His Majeſty in the Creditable Stations,

<pb facs="tcp:59167:3"/>Gentile and Generous Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>What the Prince of Moraliſts ſays, You confirm.
<note place="margin">Seneca.</note> That out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Splendour, Pompous Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and the other Pieces of Pageantry, which Attend thoſe in Power, make up but the leaſt Part of a Brave Man; for now when You ſtand Diveſted of thoſe Honours, which were no leſs the Reward of Your Deſert, than Marks of Your Prince's Favour; You retain that Stock of Merit, that Greatneſs of Mind, that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of Soul which Heaven on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſtows upon ſpecial Favourites: And none but Perſons of Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Geniuſes ſtill Poſſeſs in all Turns and Changes. And the Beams of Your Virtues are no no leſs Radiant when Separated from thoſe external Accoutrements,
<pb facs="tcp:59167:4"/>nor leſs impreſſive of Eſteem, or Attractive of Love, from Wiſe and Diſcerning Perſons. It is true, theſe Circumſtantial Appennages may affect the Populace, and conciliate ſome Cringes, Submiſſions, and Courtſhip; in which there may be more of Faſhion, Conſtraint and Policy, than of Sincerity, Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity or Affection; but the other Penetrate Hearts, Captivate Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and Eſtabliſh an Empire o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Souls even of the Better and more Refin'd ſort of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>Hence, theſe of this kind who have the advantage of Your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, earneſtly Covet the frequency of Your Converſe; which could never be ſo Ardently deſir'd by the Good, the Great, and the Ingenious of the City, Court and Countrey, if Your Prudence and
<pb facs="tcp:59167:4"/>Complaiſance, Your Acuteneſs of Spirit, and Debonairneſs of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, made it not Agreeable, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable and Beneficial, Conjunct reſults of the other happy Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: Neither of them to be met with ſo harmoniouſly Cement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but in Souls of no common Elevation; therefore, by all conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Perſons, Honoured and Loved beyond the Ordinary.</p>
            <p>For if either of theſe Qualities ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately found, be ſufficient to raiſe the Reputation of ſome; What may we conclude, when we ſee them meet and and embrace each other in ſuch a happy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, whereby they Fortifie and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie one another by their Mutual Aid and Luſtre; but that they ſhall prove ſecure Supporters of a growing Fame, and laſting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown. And if Nature had not
<pb facs="tcp:59167:5"/>drawn the firſt Strokes, and laid, as we ſay, the ground-work of theſe Accompliſhments in the Faculties of Your great Soul; Your Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among Strangers and Foreign Embaſſies, though they have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them a comely Tincture, yet could never make them go off with that Facility and taking Air, which ſpeak them to be the Effects of Your Natural Temper, poliſh'd by the dextrous Improvement of Your Ingenuous Education.</p>
            <p>It was by theſe Steps You made Your Aſcent to the Illuſtrious Poſts You paſſed through: And by the Favour of Providence You will perſevere in the ſame courſe of Virtue; to the further Service of Your Prince, the Credit and Benefit of Your Country, to God's Glory, and Your Friends Comfort: Which none wiſhes

            <head>TO MY FRIENDS AND Acquaintances IN THE CITY OF EDINBOURGH.</head>
            <p>DUring the Twenty Years I had the Honour to Serve in the Miniſtry among you, I could not but Contract Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with many, and Friendſhip with ſome of the Inhabitants. However I
<pb facs="tcp:59167:7"/>am not ſuch a Flatterer of my ſelf, as to imagine, I want Enemies: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that, beſides the Natural fick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leneſs of Peoples Affections, how li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able they are to Change from the ſupervening Contingencies, occaſioned by the different Aſpect of Affairs, and the various Turnings, that hapned in ſo long a tract of time; in which Perſons in Publick Poſts, are often hook'd in, to be intereſs'd by ſome ſingular Emergents, more than by Choice or Inclination.</p>
            <p>Yet this I will ſay, whatever Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies I may have, Miſtake on my part more than Deſign, and ſome unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Circumſtances or unlucky occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions on the other ſide, more then ill Nature, made them become ſuch. For although at a diſtance now from you, I cannot but bear witneſs, that in the ſeveral Parties among you, there are Perſons of Piety and Prudence, of Learning and Diſcretion, of Breeding and Integrity; who will not be eaſily biaſs'd by Humour, or Opinion, to malicious Apprehenſions, ſlanderous Expreſſions, or unjuſt Practices.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:59167:7"/>
            <p>I never loved the uncharitable, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious, unchriſtian way too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent in the Diſcourſes and Writings of ſome of the Age; Who charge the faults and miſcariages of particular Perſons of different Intereſts, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions from them, on whole Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. 'Tis ſaid that all the <hi>Florentines</hi> are not <hi>Wits,</hi> nor all the <hi>Switzers Block-heads:</hi> No more do I think that all the <hi>Epiſcopaliſts</hi> are <hi>Saints,</hi> or the <hi>Presbyterians Reprobates;</hi> verily I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>whoſoever</hi> of either of theſe <hi>Fears God and works Righteouſneſs,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 10.35.</note> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by God,</hi> and ſhould be ſo by Man likewiſe. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> vanity of confining the favour of heaven to Times and Places, is tranſplanted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and this with the ſowrneſs of their tempers too much tranſcribed by many, who ſacrifice all Offices of Charity and Humanity to their Narrow Opinions; not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that theſe are due to <hi>all that in every place call upon the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, our Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2.</note> both theirs and ours.</p>
            <p>Although I began the Courſe of my Miniſtry among you when I was
<pb facs="tcp:59167:8"/>very young, before I arrived to that Conſiſtency of Age preſcribed by the <hi>Canons;</hi> the neceſſity of the Church in that juncture, and the Indulgence of my Superiours, more than any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturity of my parts, ſuſpending the Obligation of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Law;</hi> Yet my Early Endeavours in the work of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> met with welcome Reception, and while I continued in that Station, my pains by the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God became in ſome degree helpful to the Spiritual Benefit of ſome of you; ſo that I may preſume in a manner to ſay with the <hi>Apoſtle;
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.1.</note> That neither my entrance, or abiding with you were in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſs it was uneaſie to me, to leave the Poſt I was in among you; for I had a ſtrong Conviction upon me to Serve in the Miniſtry, to which I was Called, and for which, through the Grace of God, I acquired ſome Fitneſs by ingenuous Education in your <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity;</hi> and where, if I did any good through the Divine aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance towards the Converſion, or Confirmation of any, in the great truths of Religion, or Practice of
<pb facs="tcp:59167:8"/>Godlineſs, I might in my more Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Age, have Riveted the ſame, and promoted it to further Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and poſſibly have made up the defects of my General, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Vocation in the inconſiderate, as well as inconſiderable paſt part of my Life, by a more ſerious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of my ſelf in my latter Days to the Duties of both.</p>
            <p>I freely declare I was loth to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from a place, to which I ow'd any ſmall meaſure of Breeding, or Learning I was endowed with; and where, after my Running through the ordinary Stages of Students in your Schools, I ſoon became a Publick Teacher of others; and ſpent the beſt portion of my time in ſome Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Returns of Affection from the fineſt of the Inhabitants. Where I could not walk the Streets without the Regret of ſome for my not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, the Compaſſionate wiſhes of others for my Return, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Counſels of many to conform to the Eſtabliſhment then. Where, I could not paſs without often inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption from the kind Approaches of
<pb facs="tcp:59167:9"/>the Children of honeſt Neighbours, and the Affectionate Civilities of their Parents. And I cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the weakneſs, or ſhall I rather call it the Natural tenderneſs of my Conſtitution ſuch, that I was not a little ſoftned, and my Reſolutions made ſomewhat fluctuating with the Fondneſs of of the Younger ſort; and there is ſomething in their way of expreſſing their liking, which as it is more ignorant and unaffected, ſo it is better and more eaſily felt, than is eloquently deſcribed; and is more impreſſive than the ſtudied Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and artificial Addreſſes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of riper Age; and is frequently the Eccho of the Parents Example and Reſpect, as well as the Reſult of inſtruction and diſcipline.</p>
            <p>Beſides that ſome whom I had Baptized and frequently Catechis'd, had been Married by me, (and many more likely would have been ſo, had I continued longer) who received me into their Houſes with equal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Affection and Eſteem, ſo that the kindneſs of Young and Old went very near to preponderate my Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb facs="tcp:59167:9"/>of coming away. All which begot in me a flattering expectation, that if I had ſtay'd with you until old Age had ſeized on me, ſince I ſpent my Vigour and Strength among you, you might have been the more eaſily Induced to bear with the Decays and Infirmities of my declining State. But 'its poſſible it might prove otherwiſe; Peoples preſent favour is but a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Security of their future Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I have known the beſt of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and the ableſt Miniſters, have their <hi>Hoſanna</hi>'s turned into <hi>Crucifige's;</hi> not only from the muddy Mob, but from thoſe who look upon themſelves as of a finer Clay: Yet often when the <hi>Maggot</hi> takes, the Populacy become the ſervil Inſtruments of their Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and the proſtituted Tools of their Inſolency, againſt their Civil Governours, and Spiritual Directors. Perſons Reſpect and Love to their Paſtors in great Cities, like the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dew vaniſhes before the Abilities and Parts of their Teachers come to their Noon, or begin to Decline; and who knows but divine Providence foreſeeing it, would prove ſo to me,
<pb facs="tcp:59167:10"/>upon my longer ſtaying among you: And for other wiſe Ends permitted my Removal ſo, leſt I ſhould meet with ſuch an afflicting Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>My maintenance among you was not Mean, and the neceſſities of my Family required my Continuance in my Charge, for their more comfortable Suſtenance; and I doubt not but I could have made my Incomes greater by following this gentile Method of Writing, which I found formerly ſo ſucceſsful towards the increaſe of my Fortune; and I could that ſame way have attracted the favour of ſome <hi>befriending Planet</hi> to better my Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtill.</p>

I do not Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate this with that Feminine Vanity, ſome ſilly Dames reckon up the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their Courtiers; who take e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very tranſient Glance, for one of <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> Meſſengers, and conſtruct every civil Complement an Amorous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue: But I do it, to ſhew that I am not led by humour or partiality, ſo far as to neglect thankful Returns to obligeing Overtures, from whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Corner they come. And although I could as little comply with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, as with the principles, by which they were Acted; yet ſince they thought them beſt, and the other was calculated ſo much for my worldly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and they were ſo very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious to engage me in their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, by which I would in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity have bettered my Temporal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, above what it is for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or I expect it to be in haſte; I cannot but conclude it an Inſtance of good Will and Eſteem; for which the <hi>Living</hi> have my thanks, and I'le pay ſome tribute of acknowledgment to the Memory of the <hi>Deceaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:59167:11"/>
            <p>I may add without any Oſtentation, and appeal to the experience of ſome of you, that the inoffenſiveneſs of my Conduct, and Carriage in my general Converſation, and particularly in my Behaviour with, and towards Diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, conduced to ſtate me ſo fair in the good likeing of the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and to procure me the favour of the Magiſtrates who have Governed the City, ſince the Scene of Affairs turn'd ſo propitious to that Party: My Gentleneſs formerly in reference to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſants, bearing down the prejudices which ſome thought might duly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough be faſtened on my Principles: The goodneſs of my Pariſhioners, and the diſcretion of them who then bore Rule among you, would not allow them to transfer any hatred they had at my disproving Sentiments of their Government, to my Perſon,; ſo that through their beningn Temper, the difference of my Opinion was no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of their Benevolence. And as I made not diverſity of Judgment the Standard of my Deportment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others of different Perſwaſion from me, nor would I be provoked
<pb facs="tcp:59167:11"/>thereby, to any raſh Treatment of them, when it was in my power to create them Trouble: No more did they upon the Revolution, make my diſſenting from their Maxims, any hindrance of their kindneſs towards me. And this want of diſtinction in the acts of their Generoſity diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes them with Honour, and a greater Senſe of true Chriſtianity in not only many of their own, but even of our party too.</p>
            <p>This appeared in the Gratuities which your <hi>Common Council</hi> twice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on me, when the circumſtances of Affairs, and my diſcontentedneſs with them, would not permit me to tarry longer in the Exerciſe of my Miniſtry among you. And I cannot but Record with Gratitude the Civility with which Sr. <hi>John Hall</hi> of <hi>Dunglaſs</hi> then head Provoſt, uſed me; and ſince I hear he is Dead, I muſt do the Juſtice to his Memory, as to declare he kept that ſereneſs of Dispoſition and equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Mind, that modeſty of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and humility of Deportment in in his Elevation, which was his Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when he ſtood on the ſame Level
<pb facs="tcp:59167:12"/>with his Neighbours. He was of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Ballaſt than thoſe who are transformed unto Starchneſs and Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, by the increaſe of their Eſtate, or the Dignity of their Station, in his Publick Miniſtrations and private Tranſactions; plain, upright Dealing was his Policy, and at Home as well as Abroad, Religion was the Compaſs he Steered by.</p>
            <p>I muſt likewiſe mention with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Reſpect the Worthy and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Gentleman Sr. <hi>Archibald Muir</hi> of <hi>Thorntown,</hi> who ſucceeded Sr. <hi>John Hall</hi> in the great Truſt of chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate in the City, and at this Inſtant for the ſecond time, in regard of his more then Ordinary Merit, and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Abilities. is inveſted with the ſame Power and Dignity again, who by the calmneſs of his Temper, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion of his Behaviour, the prudence of his Conduct, and his Juſtice in the management of his Authority, forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly attracts to him the good Opinion, Eſteem and Affection of all Impartial and unbyaſſ'd Men of both Parties.</p>
            <p>Nor can any thing leſs be expected of a Gentleman of his Birth and Pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
<pb facs="tcp:59167:12"/>being Deſcended of the Ancient Family of <hi>Rowallan,</hi> whence many of our Kings have derived their Blood.</p>

            <p>Therefore to avoid all ſuſpicion of Ingratitude as well as Injuſtice; let me caſt back my Eyes on the former times, and ſay that in thoſe Days there were thoſe by their Birth, Prudence and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, brought additional Luſtre to the

            <p>This worthy <hi>Nehemiah</hi> for Sixteen Years together was <hi>Provoſt,</hi> or <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> of the City of <hi>Edinborough,</hi> his Birth rais'd him beyond the level of ſome of his emulous Competitors in the State, and his Envious Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries among the Citizens; by which he preſerved the honour of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſtry</hi> from Contempt of the inſolent, who bore themſelves haughtily on ſcore of their Pedegree; as by his integrity and care he defended the Revenues of the <hi>Good Town</hi> from the Encroachments of the Covetous.

            <p>Here was a kind of <hi>Triumvirat</hi> in one Man; the <hi>Provoſt, Senator,</hi> and <hi>Councellour,</hi> and he ſo conſideratly well divided his time in the exerciſe of each of theſe <hi>Truſts,</hi> that the one never interfer'd with the other; his attendance on the duties of any of them never made him ſlack or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of thoſe of the other; the care of the <hi>Provoſtry</hi> never hindred the buſineſs of the judge; nor was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe an impediment to the application of the <hi>Councellour,</hi> for the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Countries</hi> Intereſt.

            <p>OUT of that intire Obedience which I ſhall ever pay to your Commands, I writ the enſuing <hi>Paraphraſe;</hi> and unleſs the common Fate of all Poets (which is, to be fondeſt of their laſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions) very much blinds my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I think the honour you have lay'd upon me in this Requeſt, has informed the piece with a greater Genius and Spirit, than uſually attends my Writings. I am not inſenſible that 'tis as natural for a Poet to flatter himſelf as his Patrons;
<pb facs="tcp:59167:19"/>but here my wiſhes conſpire with my weakneſs, to put the beſt varniſh over the humble preſent, and make it ſeem in ſome meaſure worthy your acceptance. <hi>Buchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan, Oldham,</hi> and <hi>Woodford</hi> have been happieſt in their verſians of this <hi>Pſalm;</hi> till I finiſh'd my own, I avoided ſeeing their Compoſures: chooſing rather to correct my thoughts by others Works than deſign by them. The only one I may have ſeem'd to follow is Mr. <hi>Oldham,</hi> the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect I have for this Anthor cannot biaſs my judgment ſo far as to overlook his faults; his Digreſſions are too long even for Pindarick Poetry; his Verſe wants Number and Cadence: but the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable fault, is that the Pathetick Air of this <hi>Pſalm</hi> is not obſerved with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etical Juſtice. I would not in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate our modern Writers, firſt to ſteal immediatly from an Author, then Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Rail at him, that the World may not ſuſpect them. I hope your lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure will permit you to Read him, at once to juſtifie the Character I have given, and to ſee how induſtriouſly I have avoided even the Reſemblance of Thoughts and Expreſſions, tho' the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject be the ſame.

I Reverence the <hi>Divine
<pb facs="tcp:59167:23"/>Wiſdom</hi> in the toſſings, tumblings and all the diſappointments I have met with, and I heartily bleſs the Name of my God for the ſmalneſs my Living in this Obſcure place: where if any light communicated to me from the Raies of the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> may ſhine to the benefit of others, for the advancement of his glory, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from you, and diminution of of my temporal State, ſhall not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict me; nor will I repine at any diſadvantagious change as to Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, which may befal me; if, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I come, or whatever my out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward condition be, I may through God's bleſſing be an inſtrument to ſet forth his Goſpel, or ſet up his honour, in any ſtation though never ſo low, whereon theſe can be raiſed. For as to worldly Accommodations, I have by the <hi>Divine Aid</hi> acquired ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of ſuch a holy Indifferency, that I can ſay in ſome meaſure, (and my ſervent deſire is that more and more from entire Reſignation I may freely and ſincerely aſſert) <hi>I am willing to want, what God is not willing to give.</hi>

            <p>IT is ſtrange to conſider, tho' Senſe as well as Faith, Reaſon as well as Religion, Morality as well as Divinity conſpire to convince us that this World is not our Home, nor the Earth the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of Reſt, nor this Life the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of our felicity: yet we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be deceived by the ſpecious Phantaſms which flatter our Eyes, the glittering accommodations which gratifie our eaſe, and the pleaſant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements which enchant our appetites, ſo as to neglect (if not wholly aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don) all care and concern of a future State; as if in the midſt of Revolution of Kingdoms, Diſſolution of Churches,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59167:28"/>Tumbling of Crowns, and Caſting down of Mitres: and in the throng of all ſucceſſive Variations, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Changes of univerſal Nature, we alone were priviledged with Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity and our <hi>Mountain</hi> to Remain <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable.</hi>

            <p>It is very odd, when we may Read our fate in the continual viciſſitude of all things about us, we ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from thoughts of our own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtability and periſhing condition, nor can any thing cure this folly, (but that is too Soft a term) I muſt Rather ſay, nothing can correct this Madneſs, or purge us of this deſperate Frenzy, more than often and earneſt applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Minds to a ſerious Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our Quality and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in this World: Which is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the Scriptures repreſented under that of <hi>Pilgrims</hi> and <hi>Strangers,</hi> than which nothing can afford us a truer notion of our Selves, or frame us to a more agreeable diſpoſition or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in all Alterations.</p>

            </p>
            <p>What Indications of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Zeal, of his great concern about them in this matter, of the weight and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of what he propoſes to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians obſervation and practice, are contained in this Preface! And ſo far as I can remember, Theſe two intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductory half Sentences, <hi>Dearly beloved, I beſeech you,</hi> meet not together in any paſſage of Scripture, but this one verſe, and it is truly to be regarded, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately, either of them is the Prologue or Introduction to ſome matter of Note and Conſequence, like an <hi>Aſteriſque</hi> or Hand in the margent of a Book, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59167:29"/>ſo what may we reckon them, when both united: But that they are like <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> the forerunner of ſome extraordinary remarkable purpoſe; like the Tolling of the great Bell upon ſome ſolemn Sacred occaſion, to excite and rouze up Mens Spirits, to attend and regard what follows; or ſhall I compare them (for as ſoft and as ſmooth as they run) to the Sound of a Trumpet, or diſplaying the Enſigne of Battle, or to a great Alarum in the Camp before the Fight; for this alluſion may be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified from the Warfare in the Rear, (ſo to ſpeak) of that forementioned place, <hi>abſtain from fleſhly luſts which War againſt the Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With what affectionate Compellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on do's the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> path his way. <hi>Dearly beloved!</hi> Love is a good uſher to clear the avenues for acceſs, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure acceptance to Paſtors Meſſage, if it be a ſharp Reproof, 'tis as Oyl to the Nail that makes it pierce more eaſily: if it be Counſel or Advice, 'tis as Honey to the Pill, to make it glide more pleaſantly into our hearts; Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance 'tis one of the ſtrongeſt wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons in Chriſtian Orators Spiritual Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59167:29"/>or Artillery, to Conquer the Obſtinate, to ingage the Indifferent, to melt an Adverſary, or confirm friends; to reſpect their perſons, value their Office, and comply with their deſire. But there is a higher ſtrain in it, this additional word <hi>Dearly</hi> ſhews it was no faint wiſh or roving fancy: it was not an inconſiderate Fit, or an indifferent degree of kind inclination: No, no; it was a fervent and conſtant, a ſtrong and ſerious diſpoſition to promote their Intereſt; in which there was more of a Holy flame than Human Fleſh, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout affection, than natural paſſion, of Heavenly warmth, and Chriſtian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, than of any of theſe ingredients; which in the commerce of the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the World, commonly mix themſelves with our ordinary pretences of kindneſs and good-will.</p>
            <p>And this certainly made the <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> become their <hi>ſubmiſſive Petitioner</hi> in this earneſt and humble manner, <hi>I beſeech</hi> you. Men command their Servants, counſel their Friends, entreat their Equals, but they <hi>beſeech</hi> their Superiors and betters: whence flows this humility, this modeſty, this

            <p>I muſt ſay St. <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> learned this obliging man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Addreſs, from him who was their <hi>Maſter:</hi>

            <p>And I am ſure, there is nothing

            <p>There is not the leaſt Creature that

<note place="margin">Natura in minimis major, in infimis ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limior, in contemtis admirabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lior.</note> or that of an excellent Mechanick in ſome ſmall narrow Engine; ſo there are more curious Lineaments of the Divine hand, in ſome little parcels, than in more ample draughts of his pencil.</p>
            <p>Nor are the degenerate daſhes and Aberrations of Nature without their uſefulneſs. They ſerve as patches to the more comely and regular parts, or as ſhades to increaſe the luſtre of the more noble pourtraitures, by which variety our curioſity is gratified as well as the beauty of the other more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent productions advanced. And they are ſometimes chaſtiſements of our ſins, declarations of God's controverſie, or preſages of ſome great Revolutions and Calamity. For when Nature runs out of its Courſe or ordinary Channel, either in Monſters or Tempeſts, in Plagues, extraordinary Puniſhments, or in the diſorderlineſs of the Seaſons; Theſe are the frightful marks of Gods angry Arm, whereby he nurtures the rebellious World to fear his ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59167:35"/>ſince it would not be kept in order by his Clemency.</p>
            <p>You ſee then, there is nothing in the univerſe but may furniſh the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Pilgrim</hi> ſubject for pleaſant medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or profitable inſtruction: He is a Spiritual <hi>Chymiſt,</hi> to extract pious reflections from all occurrences, he converts every thing into an occaſion of Religion, he makes his very recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion an inſtrument of Devotion, and when he diverts himſelf in viewing the beautiful variety of Natures delicacies, he entertains himſelf with ejaculations, concerning the Creators wiſdom and goodneſs. His very divertiſements drives him nearer his Heavenly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: And theſe things which retard him in his journey, by ſtaying his Eyes or faſtening his attention on them, are happy furtherances of his Spiritual progreſs, and the very pauſes of his feet puts his Soul in motion, and the poring down-caſt looks of his Eyes, is a mean of the elevation of his mind towards his maker.</p>
            <p>Hence his tongue keeps pace with the mounting of his thoughts, and his expreſſions bear the Impreſs of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59167:35"/>lineſs of his diſpoſition: The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of his mouth is the beſt Comment on the Contemplation of his Mind; and this leads me to a Second reflection upon our <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> and <hi>Pilgrims.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We know ſuch are eaſily induced al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt upon every Turn and Occaſion, to run out in ſpeeches of their own Countrey, and its Concerns: And they are glad of an opportunity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may Prudently and Diſcreetly repreſent it to Advantage;

            <p>Thus the <hi>Chriſtian Pilgrim</hi> keeps freſh on his heart the <hi>Ideas</hi> of Divine matters convey'd to him by ſenſible Objects, and his Diſcourſe ſavours of Spiritual things, his Converſe is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly; There is a Vein of Piety that mixes it ſelf with moſt of his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and ſociable Entertainment: His Language follows the temper of his Mind: His Words are the Interpreters of his Thoughts, &amp; the Intelligencers of his Affections.</p>

            <p>Now all this heavenly Strain of Thought and Diſcourſe, whereby the <hi>Chriſtian Pilgrim</hi> is diſtinguiſht from the Common Traffickers of the World, is the Reſult of that conſtant remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance he retains, and fervent Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he bears his Celeſtial Country, which no diſtance or abſence can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from his Mind.

            <p>Thus devout <hi>Pilgrims</hi> meet with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing while eſtrang'd from Heaven, that can ſtifle their longings after it. The Dignities of the World cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate their Deſires, nor can its Dainties beget in them an Oblivion of its Joys: Its faireſt <hi>Scenes</hi> do not Chaſe it from their.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59167:40"/>byaſs their Love from it. They count whatſoever is Amiable in Art, or admirable in Nature, too much Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifi'd, when they prove to them but Dark and Obſcure Repreſentations of its Glory. They conſider them no more than as <hi>Opticks,</hi> by which they take the height and excellency of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial things; They make uſe of them not only as tranſparent <hi>Perſpectives</hi> to carry their Spiritual Sight higher, but as burning Glaſſes to reflect the Rays of Divine things more warmly into their Hearts, whence their heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Thoughts become more intenſe by the meditation of thoſe <hi>Terrene</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
            <p>O the <hi>ingenious Efforts</hi> of a heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Soul, which is able to make the moſt ſeemingly Oppoſite contrarities, <hi>Vehicles</hi> for carrying it home to its own Country: Or ſhall I ſay, here is a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter piece of its magical Art, that it can preſent a Map of Heaven ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, without any Deluſion of Senſe. Here is no external Deceit, nor ſinful Invention of Art, the Impreſſions here are Intimate, beyond what any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Imagery</hi> can produce: Innocent
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59167:41"/>without Guilt: Raviſhing without Noiſe; and Permanent without cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: which in deſpight of all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or medial Reſiſtance, point forth our Countrey to our view, ſo that no Opacous Body can Eclipſe it from our Sight, none of the poliſhed <hi>Glories</hi> of the World leſſen it in our Eſteem, nor the Courtſhip of its competing Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhments interrupt our Affections therefrom.</p>
            <p>O how great is the Energy of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love, which can Convert every thing to promote its Approach to, and Union with its Object. The painted Spectacles, the pompuous Parade, the glittering Profits, the luſcious Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and the other flattering Vanities, of a falſe fawning World, which da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle the Eyes, darken the Minds, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the Deſires, and detrude the Souls of poor Mortals: Theſe which are the precipices of the Ruine, the ſtumbling Blocks, for the fall of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of the Children of this World, become ſtepping Stones to mount the Spirits of divine Lovers Heaven-ward; that they aſcend thither by the ſame Stairs, by which others tumble to the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59167:41"/>Regions of Darkneſs and Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And they are ſo ſwallow'd up in ſerious Speculation of, and fervent Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to their heavenly Countrey: That as there is nothing ſo remote, Obſcure or Oppoſite, but can bring it into their Minds, expoſe it to their View, and raiſe their Hearts thereto: So they are Blind to the ſhining atrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the Earth, and Deaf to the <hi>Syrene</hi> Songs of all its tempting Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities: That they look down from this Mountain of Contemplation, with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and Deſpection upon all <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities.</hi> And for as diſtant as they are from Heaven, and that they have but faint Glimmerings of its Light, or few Cluſters of its Comforts, yet they have ſo much as Tarniſhes the Luſtre, Withers the Beauty, Imbitters the Taſte, Blunts the Force of all Worldly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, when they ſtand in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to, or in Competition with it, for their Love; They are no more Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with thoſe things, then a dead Man is with Shews and Dainties, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick and Paſtimes; This is indeed to <hi>be Crucified to the World,</hi> which leads
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59167:42"/>to Conſider in the <hi>fourth</hi> Place the <hi>Chriſtian Pilgrim</hi> as he ſtands diſpoſ'd to the World.</p>
            <p>We know <hi>Pilgrims</hi> do not clog themſelves with unneceſſary Burdens, or ſuperfluous Encumbrances, Theſe hinder their Progreſs, and make them drive on heavily with as little Pleaſure as Speed: Thus <hi>Chriſtian Paſſengers</hi> ſhake from them all undue Eſtimation of, or inordinate Affection to the World, as well knowing there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can Retard them more in their March, nothing can Obſtruct the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their Affections to the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Bliſs while in the Way, or the Reception of their Souls into thoſe Manſions of Glory above, at their Journeys end, like worldly Love. This blinds the Eyes, ſlacks the Pace, and impedes the Entry of ſome <hi>Pilgrims</hi> into the <hi>Land of promiſe:</hi> This extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes the Love of God and their Countrey in their Hearts.

            <p>Did we as heartily and ſeriouſly mind and Love our Country as we pretend: Did we Strive and Struggle againſt our Luſts as againſt our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors for Places of Gain and Perfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the World. Did we Watch and Pray, ſit up Late and riſe Early to ſecure Heaven; were half of that Diligence and Pains transferr'd to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Exerciſes, which we Laviſh out on worldly Projects, or covetous Practices, on luſtful Intreagues or ambitious Deſigns, as our progreſs to our Home would be more Swift, ſo our Succeſs would be more Sure.</p>

            <p>We know <hi>Pilgrims</hi> are not like thoſe who go to Sea for Paſtime, or Walk abroad for Pleaſure; whom a little blaſt of Wind or breath of cold Air, a ſmall appearance of Rain, or a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering Cloud, a little uncleanneſs or unevenneſs in the Way hinders from ſetting forth, or frights ſoon from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward: No, they are reſolved to keep on in their Way, be it Smooth or Rough, be it Plain or Hilly, be the Weather Fair or Foul; and although

            <p>Is not this, in more familiar Terms, but the very ſame indifferency the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> ſpeaks of to the <hi>Romans</hi> when he would have them <hi>uſe the World as if they uſed it not,</hi>

If Poverty, Diſgrace, Pain or Affliction, be the Way that is Chalk'd out for us, we will not Balk,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59167:46"/>we know this to be the beaten Road, in which the glorious Company of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the goodly Fellowſhip of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> the noble Army of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> the honourable Society of <hi>Confeſſors,</hi> that <hi>cloud of Witneſſes</hi> and <hi>Catalogue</hi> of <hi>Worthies,</hi> which went before us, have tread: And we muſt not look that ours ſhould be Strew'd with Roſes and Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, if we Trace their ſteps, or expect their Palms.</p>

            <p>Let me freely Addreſs my ſelf to all <hi>Chriſtian Pilgrims,</hi> and tell them how incongruous a thing it is that we who profeſs our ſelves <hi>Strangers</hi> in this World, ſhould behave ſo unlike the Captain of our Hoſt, and his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59167:49"/>whom we pretend to Love and Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. Look upon the whole Courſe of his Life, and you'l find nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in but iſſues of Tenderneſs and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of Love and Benignity: <hi>He went about doing good</hi> while we do all the miſchief we can, turn every thing top-ſide-turfwiſe, that croſſes our Humour, or that thwarts our pittiful, narrow In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. How unaccountable is it, that while he preſents us the meekneſs of a Lamb, we ſhould tranſcribe it in the rage of a Lyon, or the cruelty of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; That while he preſcribes to us the <hi>Innocency</hi> of a Dove, we <hi>Bite one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother like Dogs,</hi> ſting like Serpents, and breath out nothing but the Gall and Venom of Aſps; That he ſhould ſpeak in a <hi>ſtill Voice,</hi> and we thunder Hail-ſtones and coals of Fire. That he ſhould pray for his Enemies, and we curſe our beſt Friends and <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matize</hi> all that oppoſe our Opinion, or ſeek to rectifie our Miſtakes. Alas, this is not agreeable to the Condition of <hi>Strangers</hi> and Pilgrims; if we make meekneſs and peaceableneſs the <hi>Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtick</hi> of thoſe who Travel to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Country, and look for another
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59167:50"/>City, we muſt ſeek for them elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, than where we live: Where Malice and Bitterneſs, Strife and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy tage ſo Violently, that by this we may beſt be diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of the World. It was not ſo of Old, when <hi>behold how they love one another</hi> was the honour and badge of their Profeſſion, and the wonder of their Adverſaries: and it wou'd be ſo ſtill, if they did keep themſelves in Concord and Uunity together, and go on in their Journey in Troops, not like ſcattered Straglers, but as a compact Army or Society of fellow Travellers. And this leads me in the Seventh place to ſpeak of as neceſſary a Character of <hi>Chriſtian Pilgrims</hi> as any I have yet nam'd, and that is their Unity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Strangers</hi> and <hi>Pilgrims</hi> who are acted by principles of Prudence, Diſcretion, or good Nature, are not more careful of peaceable calm Behaviour towards others, in the Foreign parts where they Travel; than they are of avoiding all quarrels and diſſention among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: They conſider nothing expoſes them more to the <hi>Ludibry</hi> of Strangers, retards them more in their Progreſs, or
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59167:50"/>encourages Enemies to Attacque them, than when they fall out among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the Way, or ſeparate from one another into By-Roads, and differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Parties.</p>
            <p>And it is the ſame among Chriſtians; unity is their Credit againſt the oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quie, their Cordial againſt the annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, their Bulwark againſt the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of their Adverſaries. It is no greater Security to a Kingdom or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, to an Army or any Society; than it is to <hi>Chriſtian Pilgrims</hi> and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Travellers:</hi> It is a happy <hi>Aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> when, in a regular way, many Pilgrims Confederate together, to ſtand by one another with mutual Counſel and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, in their Journey Heaven-ward. A Mans Soul may well rejoyce in ſuch Company:
<note place="margin">

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59167:51"/>and thoſe by which <hi>Chriſtian Travellers</hi> are ſet forth, flock together in Troops. <hi>Davids City compact together, our Saviours Kingdom unite,</hi> and <hi>Silurus his ſheaf of Arro.</hi> St. <hi>Pauls compleat Building</hi> or <hi>Natural Body</hi> with the agreement of its different Parts and various Functions, are no more <hi>Emblems,</hi> than Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the happineſs and ſecurity which reſult from Unity among <hi>Chriſtian Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims.</hi> And if divine Harmony were as ſtrong among thoſe of Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, as natural Affection is in the organical Body, or politick Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are among ſecular and civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, Religion would then Thrive as in its wholſom Air: The ſacred Conſtitution of our Church would be more firm; Its Members would tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the ſame diſpoſitions in aſſiſting the Weak, quickening the Lazy, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the indigent in their March; by which they would become more Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial one to another, more honourable to their Captain, and terrible to the Common Enemy, who durſt not make theſe attempts on an entire Body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he will be bold enough to ply mutinous Bands and ſcattered Fractions</p>
            <pb n="49" facs="tcp:59167:51"/>
            <p>The ſtrength of an Army conſiſts in its Diſcipline, Order and Unity; where theſe are wanting, neither its Number or Force can preſerve it from Ruin: and if the profeſſors of Religion like looſe vagrant Souldiers forſake their Poſts, or regular <hi>Aſſembling themſelves together,</hi> they may come to feed upon <hi>husks,</hi> be expoſed to wild Beaſts,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8.</note> or fall within the paw of that <hi>Lyon, who goeth about ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that they but deceive themſelves who think their following by-ways the beſt method to advance with more Safety, or arrive with more ſpeed at their deſired Reſt; ſuch are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſuffer'd, as a juſt puniſhment for their ſeparation, to be led unto Quagmires and Precipices, by the <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis fatuus</hi> of their own bewildred Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations; like Men out of their Way in a Wood, <hi>once wrong, ſtill worſe;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.15.</note> ſo dangerous it is to divide from the Church, the ground and Pillar of Truth; and do not we find that theſe who made the firſt Rupture in her U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, may read their Sin in their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? God Almighty in revenge of the Rent they made, has beaten them
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59167:52"/>with their own Rod, by permitting them to ſplit and fall aſunder into ſo many Parties and Subdiviſions; the ordinary Fate of all Broachers of Schi-ſm and Hatchers of Sedition.</p>
            <p>But that which is moſt Aſtoniſhing is that after all the Prudence and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the firſt Reformers of this National Church, after all the Courage and Conſtancy of her Martyrs and Confeſſors, after all the Zeal and Learning of her Apologiſts and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, after all former Inſtances up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Record, and freſher of later Date to our own Senſe and Knowledge of her ſtrenuouſly oppoſing Popery; any ſhould divide from her Communion, upon ſcore of her Symbolizing with <hi>Rome;</hi> and aſperſe her Worſhip and Conſtitution as Popiſh and Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: under this Flag the firſt Deſerters ſheltred themſelves, and the little Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous Parties ſince (wherewith the Church has been, and ſtill is Haraſſ'd, or the Kingdom Infeſted) have made and ſtill make the ſame <hi>Hue</hi> and <hi>Cry;</hi> although ſhe be the ſtrongeſt Bulwark of the Proteſtant Religion in the World; the richeſt Store-houſe of its ſtouteſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59167:52"/>Champions, the ſureſt Sanctuary of its perſecuted Adherents: Whereby ſhe is become the greateſt Eye-ſore to the Papacy, and the moſt invidious Object of its Curſes and <hi>Anathema's.</hi> It is ſtrange that when the Pope and Conclave ſo Inceſſantly vent their Spight and Venom againſt her, as Heretical, any in her own Boſom ſhould charge her with Affection to ſo Implacable and Avow'd an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary.</p>
            <p>From which Envious Imputation, I will not attempt to vindicate her, by muſtering up Arguments from <hi>Scripture, Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Antiquity</hi> in defence of her <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Government;</hi> that has been done over and over again to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of gainſayers: but I ſhall ſingle out ſome matters of Fact, no leſs for the honour of the Church, than the Conviction of her Malicious Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers.</p>
            <p>And firſt I would have you Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that ſome of the Compilers of the <hi>Common Prayer</hi> Book, ſuffer'd Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom, were Burned to Aſhes in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign; the <hi>Liturgy</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, and the <hi>Maſs-Book</hi> introduced.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59167:53"/>If theſe had diſſown'd the Religious Service which ſome now ſpurn; and embraced that <hi>Hotch-Potch</hi> of Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to Saints and Angels, in the <hi>Romiſh Ritual:</hi> If they had renounced the Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſubmited their Conſciences to the Pope, and the ſacred Scriptures to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> they might have avoided the cruelty of their Perſecutors. But they <hi>loved nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Lives,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 12 11.</note> nor Honours to the Death,</hi> but choſe to forgoe theſe, rather than the Faith; and God would have it ſo, that he might not want the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſuch Chriſtian Magnaminity, nor the Truth of the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the honour of the Triumph of ſuch reſolute Warriors: That the Church might not miſs the Boaſt of ſuch renowned Generals; nor the Age then, the Influential Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragment of ſuch affecting Examples; or the ſucceeding, the reviving Energy of ſuch excellent Precedents; to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorate their Faith, quicken the Courage, and fortifie the Hope of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Strangers</hi> and <hi>Pilgrims.</hi> Truly if we weigh without prejudice and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59167:53"/>this ſame Inſtance, we muſt needs Conclude they were no Friends to Popery, who upon account of their Religion felt ſo much of its Severity; nor can the publick Service of this Church be conſtructed a favourer of <hi>Romiſh</hi> Devotion, when it muſt be thruſt out, to make way for its Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Worſhip.</p>
            <p>But Secondly there is another thing I would have you conſider: And it is this that next in the late unhappy Times of proſperous Rebellion, when the <hi>Liturgy</hi> of this Church was laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide and the <hi>Epiſcopal Government</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh'd; then Anarchy invaded the State, and Confuſion the Church, Tyranny and Uſurpation poſſeſſed the Throne; Hereſie and Blaſphemy the Pulpit; Popery made more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Advances in that Interval, than in many Years before, when the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Worſhip and orderly Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of this Church kept footing. It is well enough known there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> in the Parliament Army, as the <hi>Royal Martyr</hi> in his printed Papers declared: And Mr. <hi>Monteith,</hi> who from being a Proteſtant
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59167:54"/>Miniſter turn'd to be a Romiſh Prieſt, whoſe Hiſtory of the Troubles of <hi>Britain</hi> he publiſh'd in French, and I ſaw at <hi>Nantes,</hi> confeſſes there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Prieſts ſlain at <hi>Edgehill;</hi> which, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering he was a New <hi>Proſelyte,</hi> he durſt never have averr'd, to occaſion ſo much Reproach and Scandal to a Profeſſion he had but recently Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, if Truth had not forced him thereto: And let it be remembred that the Enemies of the <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> then, and thoſe of them now Surviving, whoſe Faces are not ſteel'd with Impudence, or whoſe Hearts are not hardned with Impenitence, ſeek to remove from themſelves the <hi>Odium</hi> of the <hi>Kings execrable Marther,</hi> by charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the multitude of Jeſuites and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhly affected,</hi> in the Army therewith. If thoſe of this Perſwaſion ſhuffled themſelves into the Army by <hi>parroting the Cant</hi> of the Age, againſt the <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> and <hi>Government:</hi> If they had the Power and Cunning to wheedle others into their Net, and make them Tools and Inſtruments in carrying on the War, or execution of the <hi>King:</hi> Did not the Diſſenters then bring their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59167:54"/>and Deſigns againſt Popery to a fair Iſſue; when inſtead of Extirpating or Staving it off, it increaſed with our Diviſions, ſwarm'd in our Armies and ſpread through all the Corners of the Land.</p>
            <p>Now if we find to our woful Coſt and ſad Expences that upon the Ruin of the Church formerly, there follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Inundation of Errour and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie to corrupt the Doctrine of Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and Prophaneſs, to deſtroy the Power and Practice of Religion; That the <hi>Monarchy</hi> as well as the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> was overturn'd; that Faction in the State as well as Schiſm in the Church, Oppreſſion in the City and Country, came in on the Diſſolution of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and removal of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> Can we look for other Effects from the ſame fatal Occaſions, or (I may ſay) diſmal Cauſes, if renewed or ſet on Foot again. Indeed to expect better Fruit from the ſame Tree, rooted in the ſame luxuriant Soil, under the ſame malignant Influences, and care of the ſame cunning Dreſſers, (I ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have ſaid cruel <hi>Hackſters</hi>) is to look <hi>for Grap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But there are many in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, whoſe gray Hairs and ſnowy Heads are Crowns of glory to them, for eſpouſing the Intereſt of the King and Church; and bear theſe marks of Honour, and proofs of Valour in their Scars and Wounds, which may ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſede any more Enlargment on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: Theſe are living Witneſſes, (and, bleſſed be God, there are many ſuch Surviving in the Nations) of the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock, Religion and Property, Laws and Liberty ſuſtain'd, when <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> was abrogated, and the <hi>Liturgy</hi> abandon'd.

            <p>For it is certain, how oppoſite ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Opinions of the Separatiſts are to thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> in ſome Points; Yet as to Matters of <hi>Government</hi> they are equally Combin'd againſt the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Eccleſiaſtick Power: And the Church or Kingdom like an open Field, may be Harraſſ'd by both;

            <p>It were happy if we did conſider, that differences among thoſe of one Religion and Nation are a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the common Enemy: For in this caſe every Subdiviſion is a ſtrong Weapon in the Hand of the contrary Party: And by how much inconſiderable our adverſaries might appear to us, were we United, by ſo much the more Formidable they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to us, through our own unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Diſſentions: By which their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt is more Advanced, their hope of ſucceſs Increaſed, than by all their Plots and Stratagems.</p>
            <p>It were to be wiſh'd that the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> which is eagerly enough ſet againſt us all, and in the End would ſwallow us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction, could by a kind of <hi>Antiperiſtaſis</hi> inflame our mutual Love,

            <p>But to conclude this Paragraph, in which juſtice to the beſt reformed Church in the World, Zeal for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and Concernedneſs for all who think it worth their while to read what I have hear aſſerted, carried me to this modeſt Vindication. I therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech all by what is dear and ſacred to them, that they keep themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Pale of that Church, whoſe Doctrine is pure, whoſe Worſhip is Decent, whoſe Diſcipline is Primitive; from which ſome through weakneſs have ſo ignorantly, ſome through miſtake, have ſo inconſiderately, and others through wantonneſs, have ſo unneceſſarily departed; or ſhall I ſay, from which, ſome by wilfulneſs, have ſo unjuſtly, ſome through preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice

            <p>As I wiſh <hi>Chriſtian Pilgrims</hi> keep more cloſe and unite together, ſince their friendly Society conduces ſo much to their natural Preſervation; So I would recommend a great deal of Caution and Circumſpection to them. There is a certain jealouſie and ſuſpicion not only allowable, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in Strangers, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes extreamly for the ſecurity of their Credit and Intereſt, whetherſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they paſs, or wherever they tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. They know there is a curioſity in others to Gaze much upon them, to be inquiſitive about their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, to make ſome remarks there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Perhaps on their Birth and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, their Station and Condition, their Garb and Countrey: and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be Affliction (if Neceſſity make them Travel) or Policy (when it is but their Choice for Improvement) or Fancy, that they viſit Foreign Places; they are very wary and conſiderate; they know many things may paſs cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the Natives, which are not ſo
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59167:59"/>eaſily excuſed or indulged in them; therefore are careful to do nothing, which may expoſe them to Deriſion, Cenſure, or hard Treatment.</p>
            <p>It were happy <hi>Spiritual Pilgrims</hi> did tranſcribe this Copy in their behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; that they were more ſtrict and watchful: Many Eyes, many ſpies are over them, and a ſmall eſcape or failure in them is more Notic'd, becomes more Criminous in them, than a greater matter in a mere worldling: Many ſnares and dangerous occaſions are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, many deceitful objects to entice them, many real Foes, in the diſguiſe of pretending Friends, to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jole them; And I know no better <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulet</hi> againſt open or Secret Enemies, againſt violent Aſſaults, ſlie Inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than that of <hi>Epicharmus,</hi> Be <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Diffident.</hi> Truſt not all you ſee, though never ſo goodly or promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in appearance: Believe not all you Hear, though never ſo delectable to your Ears: Taſte not all preſented, though in a Golden Cup, it invites your Appetite, and courts your Liking with its Flavour.</p>

            <p>There is no part of Prudence more neceſſary or profitable for Mortals, than a well ordered and cautious Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>a prudent Man foreſeeth Evil and hideth himſelf; but the Simple paſſeth on and is puniſhed;</hi> It is true, the <hi>Wiſe Man</hi> ſpeaketh there of Judgments and <hi>penal</hi> Evils; but it holds as true in Reference to Moral; And a wiſe Chriſtian will See and Dread Danger, where Fools neither perceive nor fear any Inconveniency, till it be too late; He ſuſpects there may be Fire under the Aſhes; a Hook under the Bait; that the Colour which ſparkles in the Glaſs, may delude him; the Charms which flatter his pleaſing Paſſion, may bite like a Coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>katrice, and the glitterings of Gains may dazle his Eyes to his everlaſting Damage; Therefore he'll ſift well in his Thought what is Obvious to his Senſes: That the reflections of his Mind may Correct the Errours of theſe deceitful Intelligencers, and guard him, ſo far as poſſible, againſt Miſfortunes or Miſcarriages; If he unavoidably encounter ſuch things, as may prove occaſions of Evil, with
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59167:60"/>what Modeſty, Moderation and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety will he look about him; when he ſits down to his Repaſt, he'll Feed with Fear that his Table may not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Snare; when he falls into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, he Converſes with ſuch Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that lighter Freedoms ſhall not betray him to looſe Practices: He'll keep a loof from Harms way, and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's Road;</hi> He'll be loath to ſhuffle himſelf into drunken <hi>Clubs</hi> or <hi>Litigious Societies;</hi> he <hi>knows theſe</hi> are the <hi>Marts</hi> and <hi>Rendevouzes</hi> of Woes and Sorrows, of Wounds and cauſeleſs Quarrels; And that many Strangers through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertency or over-ventrouſneſs have at ſuch occaſions met with diſmal Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, ſlipt into fatal Extravagancies, and come to Tragical Ends.</p>
            <p>This Cautionary Fear is the Fortreſs of Chaſtity, the Sanctuary of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and the Guardian of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence' It is a Tutelary Angel againſt the force and ſubtilty of Sin, and all its Abettors; it is a Centinel over our own Frailty, whereby we preſerve our <hi>Integrity in the midſt of all dangerous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters: The ſuſpicious and fearful are ſafe, when the</hi> Fool-hardy and Preſumptuous

            <p>Their way is Narrow and Slippery to the <hi>Boat,</hi> and they had need look well, where to tread, and how to faſten their ſteps, that their feet ſlip not: A Malicious thought, a Luſtful glance, a Tatling Tongue, a credulous Ear, a liquoriſh Palat, a deceitful Hand, are all wry Steps, or Deviations from
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59167:61"/>the royal Road in which they ought to Walk; and they had need of a watchful Eye, a jealous Heart, a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Foot, when a miſtake is ſo eaſy, and in caſe thereof the Danger ſo Great.</p>
            <p>It is this makes many <hi>Spiritual Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers</hi> ſhy of Lawful things, that they may Work themſelves into a fear of what is ſinful.

            <p>By theſe happy Methods, Ancient <hi>Pilgrims</hi> procceded in their way, Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off all entanglements of Senſe, Stifling the Inclinations of the Fleſh, Stripping themſelves of all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances from the World, by all which they were well diſpoſed at their Journeys end, chearfully to leave it, Joyfully to commit their Souls to the Father of Spirits, and their Earthly Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle to the common Receptacle of all Living, the Grave. They conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59167:71"/>the World as the place of their Exile, yea, as their Enemies Country, and ſo were well pleaſed to forſake it, when they received their Sentence of Removal; and if we expect to <hi>finiſh our Courſe</hi> with Joy, to obtain the <hi>Prize,</hi> Aſſume the <hi>Robes,</hi> Receive the <hi>Palms,</hi> they have gone before us to take Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of; as the ſame mind muſt be in us, in reference to the other inſtances I have named, ſo likewiſe as to a hearty farewel, and contented parting with the World, we muſt look on it with the ſame indifferency and jealouſie, uſe it with the ſame ſobriety and abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, leave it with the ſame willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and reſignation.</p>
            <p>Our Condition in this World is but a Probationary State, and would you be always Striving or Running, and never receive the Crown, or reach the Prize?

It is no ſtrange thing, to ſee <hi>Infidels</hi> take Death heavily, and conſtrainedly; ſince they believe no better Life than the preſent: No wonder to ſee them go off the Stage with Roaring and Impatience, ſince they are ſeparated from their Idols, and worldly Comforts, without any expectation of a better Exchange. <hi>Atheiſts</hi> and <hi>Libertines</hi> whoſe Felicity expires with their Breath, may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Die: But how unaccountable is it,

            <p>Has not the <hi>Captain</hi> of their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the whole Hoſt of <hi>Pilgrims</hi> made their Entry by this Gate, and ſo Conſecrated and Facilitated the ſame to their Followers; it argues they have little Affection to their heavenly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, or their Company, when they are ſo loth to go hence to Enjoy it, and their Society; it diſcredits them who have gone before, as if their practice had no Influence to make them trace their Steps, with Alacrity and Reſolution: It diſheartens their Familiars, when they See; and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages them who come after, when they Hear, how Cowardly or Sadly, ſuch receive the Meſſage of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, or the News of their Delivery.</p>

            <p>Thus I have in ſome Common <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks</hi> drawn ſome Lines by the Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the <hi>Secular,</hi> for direction of the <hi>Spiritual Pilgrim;</hi> to which I could have added from the Parallel ſome more Reflections no leſs Uſeful and Genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine; but I preſume not to ſay all that could, or ſhould be ſaid on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; my own preſent Circumſtances ſuggeſted theſe, and ſuch like Thoughts unto my Mind, in my retir'd Walks; while I am now abſent from my Native Soil: And if from them I have
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59167:74"/>Copi'd out any good <hi>Plan</hi> or Form for the Reader's, or my own better deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in our Eſtrangement, mine from my Earthly, and both of us from our <hi>heavenly Country,</hi> I have my Intent; let me then by way of <hi>Epilogue</hi> ſhut up all, with this further Reflection.</p>
            <p>When we paſs through Foreign Parts, this Reflection of being <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> and <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> wants not its own Auſpicious Influence, to Curb our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs, to Hem in theſe Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies, we indulge our ſelves in, in our Native Climate, to pare off the Aſperities of our Nature, or the Blemiſhes of our unfortunate Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to compoſe us to the beſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Mind, and habit of Body; to exert the utmoſt Induſtry and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence for our Improvement in all worthy Endowments; and it would have the like Efficacy to model us to a ſuitable Behaviour in Reference to our Spiritual State, and the Relation we ſtand in to the World upon that Score, as the place of our Peregrination; where, as in a <hi>Academy,</hi> it would Engage us in all Divine Exerciſes, in purſuit of ſuch excellent Attainments;
